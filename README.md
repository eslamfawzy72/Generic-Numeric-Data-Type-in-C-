# Generic-Numeric-Data-Type-in-C-
ðŸ”¢ Polymorphic Numeric System in C++
This project implements a polymorphic numeric system in C++ that allows different numeric types (int, float, double, complex, etc.) to be manipulated uniformly through a base class Numeric. It's designed to support arithmetic, comparison, type conversion, and printing between these types â€” even when stored using base class pointers.

It also enables performing operations between mixed numeric types (e.g., int + double, float == complex) transparently and safely via dynamic dispatch.

ðŸ”§ Features

âœ… Abstract base class Numeric to represent all numeric types.

âœ… Derived classes:
Â Â Â Â Int, Float, Double, Complex, and more.

âœ… Full support for:

Â Â Â Â â€¢ Arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /

Â Â Â Â â€¢ Comparisons: <, >, ==

Â Â Â Â â€¢ Type conversions: toInt(), toFloat(), toDouble()

Â Â Â Â â€¢ Stream output using << operator for easy printing

âœ… Dynamic dispatch using virtual functions.

âœ… Heterogeneous numeric collections using std::vector<Numeric*>
